## Submitting Pull Requests

**Please follow these basic steps to simplify pull request reviews - if you don't you'll probably just be asked to anyway.**

* Please rebase your branch against the current master
* Run the `Setup` command to make sure your development dependencies are up-to-date
* Please ensure the test suite passes before submitting a PR
* If you've added new functionality, **please** include tests which validate its behavior
* Make reference to possible [issues](https://github.com/miguelramos/ng-lib-skeleton/issues) on PR comment

## Submitting bug reports

* Search through issues to see if a previous issue has already been reported and/or fixed.
* Provide a _small_ reproduction using a [plunker template](http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:757r6L?p=preview) or github repo.
* Please detail the affected browser(s) and operating system(s).
* Please be sure to state which version of Angular, node and npm you're using.

## Submitting New features

* We value keeping the API surface small and concise, which factors into whether new features are accepted.
* Submit an issue with the prefix `RFC: ` with your feature request.
* The feature will be discussed and considered.
* Once the PR is submitted, it will be reviewed and merged once approved.
